# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 5, 2026

## Introduction

TabCap ("we", "our", or "the app") is a Safari extension designed to help you manage your browser tabs and maintain focus. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use TabCap.

## Data Collection

**TabCap does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

### Local Storage Only

TabCap stores all settings and preferences locally on your device using Safari's built-in storage API. This includes:
- Your tab limit preferences
- Allowlist of URLs (if configured)
- Extension enable/disable state
- Statistics about tab usage

All this data remains on your device and is never sent to any external servers or third parties.

## Permissions

TabCap requires the following Safari extension permissions:

- **`tabs`**: To count and manage open tabs in Safari
- **`storage`**: To save your preferences locally on your device

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and are not used to collect or transmit any data.

## Third-Party Services

TabCap does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, or data collection services.

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or transmit any data to third parties because we do not collect any data.

## Your Rights

Since all data is stored locally on your device, you have full control:
- You can clear all extension data by disabling and removing the extension
- You can modify or delete your preferences at any time through the extension's settings
- All data is automatically deleted if you uninstall the extension

## Children's Privacy

TabCap does not knowingly collect information from children. Since we do not collect any data, this is not applicable.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.
